	<h1>Roberto Flores</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Roberto. I come from the city of Monterrey in northeastern Mexico. I have a B.Sc. in Mechatronics, but, during
		my Master studies, I decided to focus on informatics. After being involved in UX design during the period when I wrote my 
		Master's thesis, I vowed I would somehow return to it, and that's how I found my way into the Start Up Institute's Web Design
		track.</p>
